WITHOUT MAXX POTENTIAL, THE TECHNOLOGY WORLD DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE

People spend tens of thousands on diplomas that don't always serve the careers they want. Companies have lots of work and struggle to find the right people to hire for it. Projects and jobs are sent overseas where talent is available and less expensive.

MAXX PUTS EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY BACK TO THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE

We hire hungry learners as apprentices to hone their skills while guided by experts.
Apprentices learn by working on real projects and products for real clients. The result is seasoned developers who go out better prepared to begin their new careers.
