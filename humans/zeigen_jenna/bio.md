One morning, Jenna awoke to find that she had transformed into a programmer. She's been psyched about coding ever since. She's currently swimming with JavaScript at DigitalOcean as the Engineering Manager for their Frontend Infrastructure team. When she's not teaching pixels to party or helping keep engineers happy, Jenna enjoys climbing, coffee, and cat gifs. Her best party trick is that she wrote the most serious academic paper of her life on puns.
