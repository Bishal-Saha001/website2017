Hi, I'm Paul Chin Jr! Hampton Roads native and lover of all things technology, business, and food. I studied business, worked in finance, and went on to start a series of different companies in a wide variety of industries. I've been teaching myself JavaScript for the past year and truly appreciate all of the opportunities that software development has to offer. My current projects revolve around NodeBots and interactive art.
