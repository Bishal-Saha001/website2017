John Loy is a senior web developer at Willowtree in Charlottesville, Virginia. He's currently riding on the React-Redux bandwagon, developing primarily streaming video apps for clients like HBO. At one point in ancient times he was a web designer, so he's one of those rare web devs who doesn't hate CSS and knows how to not hang himself with that rope. His occasional urge for geek companionship and professional development led him to co-found a successful web design conference, edUI, and also the Central Virginia Javascript meetup. When not writing JS SPAs by day, he weaves in and out of parenting and the occasional lifehacking side project. Also, if it can be done on the command line, even if it shouldn't be, he'll try to do it.
