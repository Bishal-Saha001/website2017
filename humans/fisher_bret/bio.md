Hey, thanks for learning about me. I'm a freelance DevOps and Docker consultant, trainer, speaker, and Open Source volunteer working from Virginia Beach, VA.

I've been a cloud and datacenter ops/sysadmin for 20 years. Lately, I help teams Dockerize their apps and systems, and improve their speed of deployment, resiliency, metrics, and awareness. All that DevOps-y stuff.

I'm also a Docker Captain and Code for America Brigade Captain. I run several monthly meetups, speak at conferences, and love helping others. I'm obsessed with containerizing any app I see, and I'll likely talk your ear off about it next time we meet.

I sometimes develop in Node.js, Bash, and general web, usually for open source.

When not working, I CrossFit, surf a little, geekout in our awesome local dev community in Virginia Beach, and travel with my Wife. We spend our time trying to figure out how to "live deliberately" as Thoreau would say. Say hi: @BretFisher or bret@bretfisher.com
