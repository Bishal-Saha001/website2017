Juan has always been fascinated by language, having grown up speaking three. He finds refactoring therapeutic, problem solving exhilarating, and being an organizer for his local JS community fulfilling. He is lucky enough to work as a full-stack Javascript developer for Fluencia, making the world's best Spanish-English online dictionary. When not programming, Juan likes playing all types of board games and he never grew out of climbing trees.
