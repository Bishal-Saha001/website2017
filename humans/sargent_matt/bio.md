Matt Sargent is a longtime Virginia native and graduated from James Madison University with a BS in Computer Science in 1985. He has been involved in software development his entire career, starting out helping to develop an intelligence gathering system for the US Navy in Northern VA and later continuing his work with the Navy and private sector organizations in Virginia Beach. About 7 years ago, Matt landed at Marathon Consulting where he is a Team Lead and Senior Consultant. His work includes leading and developing projects for local and national clients including STIHL, Inc, LifeNet Health, and SuperSuds.

Matt is a life-long electronics hobbyist and self-taught chef who began his work by disassembling his mother’s appliances on the kitchen floor (much to her chagrin) and then moving on to soldering Heathkits together. Recently, he has been developing projects for the kitchen and household using Arduino, ESP32, and Rasberry Pi, and even going as far as designing and fab’ing his own circuit boards. Matt is also an active RC aircraft hobbyist, gardener, and father. He and his wife, Kathy, live in Virginia Beach and await visits from their two kids who are off and conquering the world on their own.
