Matt Sargent has been a life long electronics hobbyist and Smart Home geek. His first forays into microprocessor programming started with the venerable MC68HC705 8-bit micro controller back in the 1980s and has progressed up to the the current incarnations of Arduino, ESP32 and Rasberry Pi. His first Smart Home project, done back in 1997, used X10 modules and an X10 serial interface module coupled with a web server to control his home lights from the internet. Lately, he has developed an interface device that links his RC Radio system to his Android phone running an App he created to display telemetry received from the aircraft. He has been involved in software development his entire career, ranging from intelligence gathering systems for the US Navy to more recently leading projects for various clients around the Hampton Roads area. He has lived in Virginia Beach with his wife, Kathy and kids since 1989. He enjoys walking his standard poodle, cooking and gardening.
