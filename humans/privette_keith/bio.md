I am a Project\Program Manager\Scrum Master with skill sets that reach from the business processes to the conceptual technical design for many different types of businesses or technologies. I have worked on initiatives that has required me to play many different roles (many of them at the same time). This has allowed me to be flexible, adaptable, and creative to ensure delivery of the solution to the problem.
