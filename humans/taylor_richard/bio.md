I am a 25 year software development and technology professional living in Huntersville, NC. My experience includes the design and development of small to enterprise class applications. For the last 10 years, I have focused on web based applications and that is where my passion lives. I have a great deal of experience but I do like to explore new technologies, tools, and techniques to help create better software.

Currently, I'm the president and founder of New Oak Software, LLC. New Oak Software, LLC is a software development firm that creates software products in the area of personal financial management and business administration. Our firm also provides software development consulting, software development management, and product development (coding) to assist our clients in meeting their business objectives.

I am also a Tech Lead and member of a highly skilled development team at Logical Advantage in Charlotte, NC delivering software solutions utilizing the following technologies:

ASP.NET (Web API, MVC) SQL Server/MongoDB Angular Bootstrap JavaScript/NodeJS KendoUI

As a team member, I am required to develop software at all levels of the modern software stack. (Front-end, API, and data store) I also consult and provide solutions to overall software architecture and user experience which involves deep research into tool-set capabilities, reviewing trends and best practices, and development of prototypes.

When not developing software, I am focused on spending time with my lovely wife Shondrecca and our five children. (Richard, Ayanna, David, Jonathan, and Stephen)
