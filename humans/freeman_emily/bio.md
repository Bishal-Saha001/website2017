Hi, I’m Emily. I grew up in DC, but when it came time to choose a school, I decided to get a little sunshine and go to the University of Central Florida in Orlando.

I argued my way through 4 years of political science classes and loved every minute of it. I'm kind of famous for my pun-filled (not-very-funny) cheesy political jokes.

Before becoming a developer, I worked in public relations, fundraising and, most recently, ghost wrote blogs for tech startups and entrepreneurs. I'm a graduate of the Turing School of Software Development and Design in Denver.

In my free time, I’m a competitive powerlifter and can deadlift over 265 pounds!
