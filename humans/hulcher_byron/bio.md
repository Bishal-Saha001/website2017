I've been a game developer and programmer for about a decade, and enjoy teaching web and game dev to people in a variety of settings including public speaking and workshops. I've given a number of talks in the US on subjects like building interactive fiction in Twine and what we as software developers can learn from the Pok√©mon series of games. I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wife, two cats, and many longboxes of comic books. It is okay if you want to put pineapple and ham on pizza, don't let anyone tell you how to live your life.
