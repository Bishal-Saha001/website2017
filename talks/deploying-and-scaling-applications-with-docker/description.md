Take your containers into production and operate clusters like a pro. We will run a sample app on a single node with Compose. Then, we will add scaling and load balancing. We will see how to provision a cluster of Docker nodes, and deploy the application on that cluster. We will see how to perform common operation tasks, and see what built-in options are available to achieve high availability.

The whole workshop will use "real-world" demo applications with web frontends, web services, background workers, and stateful data stores, in order to cover a wide range of use cases.
You won't need to pre-install Docker before the course: each student will be given credentials to connect to an individual cluster of virtual machines. So all you need is a computer with a SSH client!

This workshop uses the latest Docker features including Swarm Mode, secrets storage, blue-green deployments, routing mesh, stacks, and more.

## Who is this presentation for? (job titles, functions, experience)

## What's the takeaway for the audience?
- How to build a multi-node, secure, Docker Swarm cluster.
- How to deploy and manage a multi-container, highly-available multi-service app inside a cluster.
- Hands on with daily and intermediate-level tasks a container cluster operator deals with.
- More jazzed about taking containers into production!

## Prerequisite knowledge for this presentation
- Know the basic container concepts of images and containers. 
- Have used Dockerfile before, or at least understand how to use them.

## Tutorial hardware and/or installation requirements for attendees
Laptop with SSH program. We'll be doing all of our work on cloud-hosted Linux instances that we'll need to SSH into.
