Take your containers into production and operate clusters like a pro. We will run a sample multi-container app on a single node with Docker Compose. Then, we will add scaling and load balancing. We will see how to provision a cluster of Docker nodes, and deploy the application on that cluster. We will see how to perform common operation tasks, and see what built-in options are available to achieve high availability.

The whole workshop will use "real-world" demo applications with web frontends, web services, background workers, and stateful data stores, in order to cover a wide range of use cases.
You won't need to pre-install Docker before the course: each student will be given their own environment in play-with-docker.com to use for the day with 5 nodes to learn with.

This workshop uses the latest Docker features including Swarm Mode, secrets storage, blue-green deployments, routing mesh, stacks, and more.
