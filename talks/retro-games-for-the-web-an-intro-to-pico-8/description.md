PICO-8 is a "fantasy console" for creating and playing small digital retro games, influenced by classic game consoles like the NES and SEGA Master System.  It includes its own shell, code editor, sprite creator, and music tracker, and distributes "cartridges" as small PNG files.  With a maximum cartridge size of 32K, a 16 color palette and a 128x128 resolution, its a great tool for building games and art with limited constraints.  Kickstart your own PICO-8 game dev with a short LUA tutorial and a walkthrough of the console's different features.  Then learn how PICO-8 makes it easy to share your projects in the Lexaloffle web player, and allows you to remix projects by other shared by devs.
