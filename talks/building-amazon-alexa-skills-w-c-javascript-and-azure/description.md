If you've ever looked into developing for Amazon Echo and were scared off by the complexity (AWS Lambda Functions? Certificates? Cloud Services?) and technical requirements (Java, Python, NodeJS... no C#?) then this is the session for you.

In this talk, I'll walk through the process from Design to Development to Publishing, and we'll do (the development) in Visual Studio, using C# and JSON. 

We'll cover voice interactions, hardware interactions, cloud services, certificates, deploying to Amazon, AWS Lambda, and also discuss controlling your home with voice commands via Alexa and a SmartThings hub. 

Voice interaction requires anticipating how you (and your customers) think, and speak. This session will help you understand the Interaction Model and the Alexa Voice Service.
