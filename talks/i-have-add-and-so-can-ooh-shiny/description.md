Neurodiversity is the hidden diversity on our teams. Unlike obvious external markers, mental and personality quirks or invisible disabilities are not always easy for us to remember or adjust for. But sometimes diversity in this area is as important as any other. 

How can you remember and honor that your team members are all experiencing slightly different realities? How can those different realities make your product and team stronger and more effective?
