All editors format code slightly differently and don't even help with
more complex situations like deeply indented syntax, which forces you
to manually break it up across lines. This becomes a point of strife
within teams. We argue about where to put spaces and break things up.
This is a waste of time. The minutiae of syntax doesn't matter at all.
Arguing about syntax and spending time enforcing it across your
projects is a big distraction from the real problems.

That's why I wrote a new kind of JavaScript formatter: Prettier. It
knows how to wrap code and always produces a consistent style. I will
show you how productive you can be if your JavaScript is automatically
formatted. Forget about your hand-crafted JavaScript, and say hello to
consistency!
