There is another massive shift happening with how we interact with companies through software. Users feel comfortable naturally talking with their applications through chat bots. Chat is the next generation of the user interface.

Companies like Slack, Facebook, WhatsApp, and WeChat have some of the most popular apps in the world and they are all betting on a messaging interface.

Ruby and it’s ecosystem of libraries can support these new types of interactions. In this session, we will see how we can build scalable, realtime web applications (or “bots”) using the Slack API. We will see what a good bot architecture looks like and how we can integrate with existing artificial intelligence services to make our bots smarter.
