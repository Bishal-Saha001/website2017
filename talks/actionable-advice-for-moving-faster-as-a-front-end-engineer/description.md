In every team or company, there always seem to be a few engineers that just seem to be faster, despite having to contend with three different fundamental technologies _(```HTML```, ```CSS```, and ```JavaScript```)_, libraries _(```jQuery```, ```Lodash```, ```Moment.js```, etc)_, and frameworks _(```React```, ```Backbone```, ```Angular```, etc)_. In this session, you'll learn specific techniques, that are both framework and text-editor agnostic, for moving faster as a front-end engineer. The techniques will revolve around implementing low-hanging fruit for improving workflow and tooling, debugging efficiently in a front-end stack, and reducing friction when implementing new features.
