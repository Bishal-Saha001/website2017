Come join me at the intersection of Nicolas Cage, JavaScript, and hardware hacks. I had zero programming knowledge and within a year I was able to create a Node.js and Arduino powered Nicholas Cage worshiping tool.

I was once lost, I thought that I would never be able to code or build a robot ... and then I was lifted out of the darkness! It was all thanks to the the positive impact that the developer community had on me. The talk is very interactive and includes a LIVE demo of the hardware. It is also a great starting point for those who wants to learn about using JavaScript to control hardware. Long time coding veterans should also attend if they find themselves stuck trying to find the perfect side project or feeling like they can't build anything new. I invite people to open their minds and realize that they are capable of building anything they want, no matter how silly it may seem.
