This talk describes Bubo: a bot based application that we built to help users learn software engineering. Unlike conventional bots that interact with a user in small sessions (10-20 request/response exchanges) Bubo presents software engineering concepts that can often encompass a whole book that is presented over multiple long chat sessions. This talk will go over the two aspects of the system architecture: The backend system that takes content from traditional text books and converts it into a conversational dialogue, and the mobile clients that use the conversational content and a modified version of ChatScript, an open source natural language Dialog Manager, to hold the conversation with the end user. We will also talk about lessons learnt and best practices in user engagement and gamification of chat experiences based on our initial trials of the application.
