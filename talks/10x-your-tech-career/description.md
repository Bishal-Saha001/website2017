I began my engineering career 10 years after I started college. I had failed early and taken a detour while others were going right from college into their new tech jobs. I had a 6-month-old child, a stay-at-home wife working hard to raise him, and a ton of debt to pay down. I used to tell my mentees at ECPI, “When you get hungry enough, you’ll eat.” I was hungry. I needed growth in a hurry. Fast forward to now: the amount I paid in taxes last year was more than my annual salary at my first developer position in 2009. Here's how I did it:

Learn by doing (LBD). Manufacture Opportunity. Punch Above Your Weight. Outpace Innovation. Growing Your Connections. Consistent Branding. Plan Your Growth. Pay It Forward.
