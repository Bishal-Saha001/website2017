I began my engineering career 10 years after I started college. I had failed early and taken a detour while others were going right from college into their new tech jobs. I had a 6-month-old child, a stay-at-home wife working hard to raise him, and a ton of debt to pay down. I used to tell my mentees at ECPI, “When you get hungry enough, you’ll eat.” I was hungry. I needed growth in a hurry. Fast forward to now: the amount I paid in taxes last year was more than my annual salary at my first developer position in 2009. Here's how I did it:

**Learn by doing (LBD)**. There’s so much value in theory, we all know this, but there’s dual value in actually building something with that new knowledge. You get practical education and you have a tangible result. People can see what you’ve done.

**Manufacture Opportunity**. A common problem junior devs face is not having experience (and at 27 years old, I wasn’t young, I was junior). Classic chicken-and-egg. Take LBD to the next level and begin building projects for non-profits and start-ups.

**Punch Above Your Weight**. Shoot for and apply for jobs that seem just out of your reach. You’ll always be challenged to grow.

**Outpace Innovation**. If you want to see high growth, outpace the current innovation of your position, and if possible, outpace your company. You have to gamble with your time. Gamble on yourself.

**Growing Your Connections**. Find people you look up to who can help you advance your career and find a way to be useful to them. Give them a reason to trust you, sponsor you, and endorse you.

**Consistent Branding**. You’ve learned, grown, and done some awesome things. Update your LinkedIn, portfolio, & resume on an ongoing basis. Don’t wait until you need a job to do this.

**Plan Your Growth**. Always be looking ahead to the next step, whether it’s at your current company or somewhere else. The work you're doing now should prepare you for your next position or venture.

**Pay It Forward**. Phew, you’ve been killing it! Still, you didn’t do it alone. It’s time to find someone you can help. A side benefit of this will be your growth as a leader and community influencer. Your circle grows :)
