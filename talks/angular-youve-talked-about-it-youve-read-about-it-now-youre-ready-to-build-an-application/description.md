There has been a lot of activity with Angular over the last couple of years.  As a developer, especially a web developer, the term/name Angular is not foreign to you.  You have probably discussed it with other developers, you have read about it in developer trade publications, and you have probably written a sample “Hello Angular” application just to get a feel for Angular’s value proposition.  Now you are ready to build a real application but you have some reservation on how to get started or if you have started, you are questioning if you are building your application correctly.  In this session, we will explore using Angular to build the major features common to all modern web applications.  This should give you a solid foundation for using Angular as an effective tool in your development toolbox.
