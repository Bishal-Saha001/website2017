We will focus during these 30 minutes on the main security issues that affect web developers today (and also affected us 10 years ago).  This will include XSS, CSRF, and SQL Injection.  While there are lots of security issues that constantly seem to pop up in the news, these 3 issues are invariably the culprit of 99% of code-based security breaches that end up happening.  Why therefore are these problems that still exist?  Mostly because it’s a hard problem to actually ‘fix’ at the core.  The web is broken in these regards.  Therefore it’s extremely important for programmers to understand what causes these issues, and how to fix them.  Especially newer programmers that never seem to have been exposed to these topics in school or on online courses.
