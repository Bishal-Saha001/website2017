You may have heard that having designers work closely with your developers is productive. You may even be looking for some of those designer-developer hybrids yourself. But is it a good thing? Is it something you should do on your team? What is the value exactly of having your designers work directly with your developers? How do you get designers into your codebase, and once they’re there, how do you keep them there?

In this talk I’ll go over some of the things we’ve learned on the Firefox devtools team about onboarding designers into what is a complex, open source codebase, how we’ve learned to work together with a ratio of 1 designer to 25 engineers, and what architectural decisions we’ve made and are working on to get even more designers working with us in the future.
