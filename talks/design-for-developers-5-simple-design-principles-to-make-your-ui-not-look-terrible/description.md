_"I can code pretty much anything, but when it comes to designing the front end, it's like I hit a brick wall."_

Does that sound familiar? 

Many developers struggle with design. Maybe you know good design when you see it but you have **no idea how to replicate it.** Or perhaps you think design is reserved for the elusive 'creative folk'. 

But a nice, visually appealing design can do wonders for your product or website. It doesn't have to be award-winning or an _'at an angle on an iMac getting tons of faves on Dribbble'_ masterpiece. But a **smart, consistent design based on solid principles will take your designs to the next level.**

I'm not going to teach you how to be a 'design rockstar' but you'll walk away with **5 rock-solid principles** that you can apply to every bit of front end work you do. If you follow the simple exercises your designs WILL improve. They'll be usable, clean and structured. 

In this talk, you'll learn:

1. A repeatable process that you can use for creating any colour palette 
2. How to achieve typographic hierarchy... with math!
3. How to choose and use fontsâ€”and the little details that will make your typography awesome
4. How to use white space to your advantage 
5. How to make stock photos not suck

You're going to walk away with a solid understanding of design principles that will not only help you in your day to day work but it will also help you and any designers you work with see eye-to-eye.
