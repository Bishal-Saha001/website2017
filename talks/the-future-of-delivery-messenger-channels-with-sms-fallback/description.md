Probably everyone remembers earlier days, when SMS was one of the most used means of communication. This times, the dissemination of SMS in private communication is decreasing whereas SMS is still often used for commercial communication especially for one-directional distribution of information from company to customer. In the future, the SMS may also lose this position and then will only serve as fallback. New channels, especially internet-based messengers like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or Threema, will become more and more important and will compete with SMS. Instead of sending SMS to customers, companies will start using the same channels for commercial conversation as their customers for private. SMS then will only be used in case an internet-based channel is not available or for time critical services.
