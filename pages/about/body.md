RevolutionConf is a two-day, platform and language agnostic, software development conference being held on June 1-2 2017.

This year, we are taking over the beautiful Wyndam Virginia Beach Oceanfront. With 15,000 sq. ft of conference space, on the world famous North End of Virginia Beach, VA, we are hosting talks from regional, national, and international thought leaders.

RevolutionConf is organized and supported by the board members of RevolutionVA, a 501c3 non-profit based in Norfolk, VA. The goal of RevolutionVA is to unite software developers in the mid-Atlantic region through conferences, and career and learning opportunities.
