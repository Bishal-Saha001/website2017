Join us at the world famous North End of Virginia Beach. Free from the hustle and bustle of tourists at the South End, the Virgina Beach Wyndham Hotel sits directly on the oceanfront overlooking their semi-private beach and the Atlantic Ocean. No other conference hotel offers such direct access to the beach.

The hotel has a large conference area with a grand ballroom, free wi-fi throughout, an indoor and an outdoor pool, and onsite restaurant. If you want to visit the nearby Virginia Beach Boardwalk, it's just a short car or bike ride away.

The Wyndham boasts 244 guest rooms with over half of them overlooking the ocean. 100% of the rooms are non-smoking. We've arranged a block of ocean view rooms at the low rate of $119/night. Supplies won't last, so call them now and mention you'll be visiting with RevolutionConf to get the discounted rates.
